WebSocket written in BlitzMax
=============================

This is a small project implementing a WebSocket as descriped [here][spec]. 
The Server is build upon [Vertex.BNetEx][BNetEx] 

Just realised (thanks k.o.g) that this is a very (very) old implementation of Draft 03 only WebKit(Safari, iOS) still use this implementation. 
For now this implementation is only usable with Safari >5.0 (maybe 4.* or so) and iOS >4.3.
