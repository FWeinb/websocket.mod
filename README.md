WebSocket written in BlitzMax
=============================

This is a small project implementing a WebSocket as descriped [here][spec]. 
The Server is build upon [Vertex.BNetEx][BNetEx] 


Now there is support for Chrome >11 (i guess) and Firefox > 7 even iOS Mobile Safari >4.3 and Safari >= 5 are supported. 
I might clean up the messy Code.
